1. Disconnect the power from the Honeywell (now Ademco) Control Panel of the Alarm System by powering-down the main panel by disconnecting one battery lead and unplugging the low-voltage transformer. If the low-voltage transformer is not in reach, instead disconnect one of the two power leads from the main panel (Port Nr 1 or Port Nr 2). The system is now no longer powered and it is safe to continue.
2. Connect one end of the supplied 4-conductor cable to the four screw terminals on the EnvistaLink 4 (EVL) module.

EnvistaLink 4 Board

3. Install the EnvistaLink 4 (EVL) in the main panel enclosure. Use the double-sided tape to attach the EnvistaLink 4 board to the interior of the metal housing cabinet.

4. Attach the conneting cables of the opposite end of the cable to the Ports of the Honeywell/Ademco Vista main panel. The ports to connect to are Port 4 - Black, Port 5 - Red, Port 6 - Green, Port 7 - Yellow, colors should match the colors of the connecting cables. These are the same terminals used for keypad connections. Be careful not to dislodge any of the existing data wiring.

5. Connect a data patch cord from the RJ-45 connector on the EnvistaLink 4 (EVL) module to an open port on your home network router or switch.

6. Restore AC and battery power to the system.

For Honeywell / Ademco systems, youâ€™ll have to program the panel to enroll the EnvistaLink 4 (EVL). Follow the latest instructions in the the next section.
